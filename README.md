# MAAML : Make Applications Apply Machine Learning


A package of under 2000 line of code for researchers in data analysis, preprocessing, machine learning and deep learning. This package can help you transform your 100 to 1000 lines of code to 10 with simple to use piplines, currently specialized in time series data analysis and uses pandas Dataframes in backend.
The package includes:

- Datasets section
- Data cleaning module
- Data preprocessing module
- Machine learning application module
- Deep learning application module

The project is still in it's Alpha phase and looking for expanding the project and improving it, we are open to contributers and collaborations.
